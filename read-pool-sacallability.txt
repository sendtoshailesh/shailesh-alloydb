pgbench --host=10.45.195.25 --username=postgres -n -c 500 -j 500 -S -T 9000 -f pgbench.sql  beforedb

READ pool of 8vCPU of 4 nodes went to 100% but when added upto 8 nodes of same vcpu then CPU reduced to 50%

on 2vcpu 1 node
pgbench --host=10.45.195.25 --username=postgres -n -c 50 -j 200 -S -T 9000 -f pgbench.sql  beforedb

Read pool of 1 node 8vcpu ---> consumes close 100%
pgbench --host=10.45.195.42 --username=postgres -n -c 5 -j 5 -S -T 9000 -f pgbench.sql  beforedb

Read pool of 2 node 8vCPU ----> consumes close to 60%
pgbench --host=10.45.195.42 --username=postgres -n -c 5 -j 5 -S -T 9000 -f pgbench.sql  beforedb

After adding a node to read pool 1 both went same CPU.
